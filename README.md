# Air-Strike

Note: Game Description

This project was undertaken by me as an independent project. This is a redeveloped version of the game 'War Battleship' I created as one of my first projects in MATLAB. This game utilises object oriented programming, user input parsing, data structures such as vectors and more! Based on the classic battleship board game, this game consists of varying levels of difficulty including secret hacks, various hints and interesting storyline gameplay. Enjoy the game!

No code was copied from any other internet sources for this project. This is an independent project undertaken by me, built from scratch!
